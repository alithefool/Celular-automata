# Custom Rules Cellular Automata

A flexible implementation of Conway's Game of Life with customizable evolution rules, written in C. This project allows users to experiment with different cellular automaton rules and observe how they affect the emergence of patterns and behaviors in the grid.

## Features
- Classic Conway's Game of Life implementation
- Customizable rules for cell evolution
- Configurable grid size
- Command-line interface for rule modification
- Efficient C implementation for fast simulation

## Technical Details
The program implements a cellular automaton where each cell's state evolves based on user-defined rules. Unlike the classic Game of Life which follows fixed rules, this implementation allows for:
- Custom survival conditions
- Custom birth conditions
- Flexible neighborhood definitions
- Adjustable grid boundary behavior

## Building and Running
```bash
# Build instructions will be added
```
